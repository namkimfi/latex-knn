\section{Purpose of k-NN algorithm}

The k-nearest neighbours algorithm (k-NN) is used to characterise single-electron pumps.
The concept of a single-electron pump follows the definition of the SI unit of current, the ampere (A)\cite{ampere}.  
One of the advantages of single-electron pumps is their relative accuracy at the level of current magnitude of $10^{-7}$ A. 
The world record of the relative accuracy for this device\cite{stein} is $\sim 2\times 10^{-7}$.
Without the help of k-NN, electron transport measurements for the uncertainty assessment of single electron pumps are time consuming depending on the accuracy level.
However, with the k-NN algorithm, the measurement time can be reduced by about a third.

Typically, the scanning parameters consist of two gate voltages, such as $V_\text{g1}$ and $V_\text{g2}$.
By scanning the parameter space of $V_\text{g1}$ and $V_\text{g2}$, a two-dimensional current density plot can be generated.
The relative accuracy of the single-electron pump is evaluated by analysing the flatness of the current plateau region in the density plot.
The flatness of the plateau is evaluated from the trans-conductance of the current plateau.
Therefore, the programme with the k-NN algorithm performs measurements of the current, $I$ vs $V_\text{g1}$ and $V_\text{g2}$.
 In addition, the measurements of $dI/dV_\text{gi}$ vs $V_\text{g1}$ and $V_\text{g2}$ are also performed,
where $i=1,2$.


\section{measurement methods and results}
We present a preliminary dataset to test the feasibility of our programme.
Using a nonlinear device, we show that the k-NN algorithm is suitable for our purposes.
Fig. 1 describes 3D plot of current $I$ ($z-$axis) vs $V_\text{g1}$ ($x-$axis) and $V_\text{g2}$ ($y-$axis) measured at $T=77$ K. Current and voltage units are nA and V, respectively. 
%V sd=0.1 V, V TR=0.4 V. 
The minus sign of the current is due to the reversed polarity of the current amplifier. 

At this temperatures, the condition $k_\text{B}T > E_\text{C} $ is met, where $E_\text{C} $ denotes the charging energy of the quantum dot. This results in the single-electron pump device, which is composed of the quantum dot, failing to exhibit single-electron transfer phenomena. However, the device demonstrated non-linear characteristics.

In this instance, the PyVISA package was utilised. The PyVISA package is a Python package that facilitates the control of any measurement device, irrespective of its interface (e.g. GPIB, RS232, USB, Ethernet).\cite{pyvisa}

The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be $1.602 176 634 x 10^{–19}$ when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A s, where the second is defined in terms of $\Delta \nu _{Cs}$.
