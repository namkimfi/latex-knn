\section{Purpose of k-NN algorithm}

The k-nearest neighbours algorithm (k-NN) can be used to characterise a quantum-dot based single-electron pumps\cite{schoinas}.
The concept of a single-electron pump\cite{bae} follows the definition of the SI unit of current, the ampere (A)\cite{ampere}.  
One of the advantages of single-electron pumps is their relative accuracy at the level of current magnitude of $10^{-7}$ A. 
The world record of the relative accuracy for this device is $\sim 2\times 10^{-7}$\cite{stein}.
Without the help of k-NN, electron transport measurements for the accuracy assessment of single electron pumps are time consuming depending on the accuracy level.
It has been shown that k-NN algorithm can reduce the time taken to assess the pumping accuracy  by multiple times\cite{schoinas}. 

Typically, the scanning parameters consist of two gate voltages, such as $V_\text{g1}$ and $V_\text{g2}$.
By scanning the parameter space of $V_\text{g1}$ and $V_\text{g2}$, a two-dimensional current density plot can be generated.
The relative accuracy of the single-electron pump is evaluated by analysing the slope of the current plateau region in the density plot.
The programme with the k-NN algorithm performs measurements of the current, $I$ vs $V_\text{g1}$ and $V_\text{g2}$.
 In addition, the measurements of $dI/dV_\text{gi}$ vs $V_\text{g1}$ and $V_\text{g2}$ are also performed,
where $i=1,2$.


\section{measurement methods and results}
We present a preliminary dataset to test the feasibility of our programme.
Using a nonlinear device made of a quantum dot whose geometry is similar to our previous one\cite{bae}, we show that the k-NN algorithm is suitable for our purposes.
Figure 1 describes 3D plot of current $I$ ($z-$axis) vs $V_\text{g1}$ ($x-$axis) and $V_\text{g2}$ ($y-$axis) measured at $T=77$ K. Current and voltage units are nA and V, respectively. 
%V sd=0.1 V, V TR=0.4 V. 
The minus sign of the current is due to the reversed polarity of the current amplifier. 
$\partial I/\partial V_{g1}$ data is also obtained and plotted in Fig.2. 
%In order to assess the pump accuracy, it is necessary to identify the plateau region. 
The k-NN $dI/dV_{gi}$ algorithm is an efficient method for identifying current plateaus during the scanning of gates  $V_\text{g1}$ and $V_\text{g2}$, while also reducing measurement time. Compared to k-NN $I$ vs $V_{gi}$ measurement, its derivative along the parameter space gives a better contrast in the pumping map.


At $T=77$ K, the condition $k_\text{B}T > E_\text{C} $ is met, where $E_\text{C} $ denotes the charging energy of the quantum dot. This results in the single-electron pump device, which is composed of the quantum dot, failing to exhibit single-electron transfer phenomena. However, the device demonstrated non-linear characteristics.

For the control of the measurement units, such as voltage sources and current multimeter the PyVISA package was utilised. The PyVISA package is a Python package that facilitates the control of any measurement device, irrespective of its interface (e.g. GPIB, RS232, USB, Ethernet)\cite{pyvisa}.


For further investigation, we are going to apply our programs to the assessment of the pumping error of our single electron pumps as well as the uncertainty evaluations.


\section{statistical analysis}

$I^m_i(x,y)$ is the current measured at gate voltages of $x$ and $y$ where $m$, $i$ stands for measurement and {\color{red}index of a list}, respectively.\\
$I^p_i(x,y)$ is the current predicted at gate voltages of $x$ and $y$ where $p$, $i$ stands for prediction and {\color{red}index of a list}, respectively.\\



	
\begin{align}
    \langle I^{m(p)}_i(x,y) \rangle &= \sum_{i=0}^{19} I^{m(p)}_i(x,y)/20 \\
    \langle I^{m(p)}_i \rangle &= \sum_{i=0}^{19} \sum_{(x,y)} I^{m(p)}_i(x,y)/20020 \\
    \langle\delta I^{m(p)}
    (x,y)\rangle & \equiv \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{19}(I^{m(p)}_i(x,y)-\langle I^{m(p)}_i(x,y) \rangle)^2 /\langle I^{m(p)}_i(x,y) \rangle^2}\\
    \langle\delta I^{m(p)}\rangle & \equiv \sqrt{ \sum_{i=0}^{19} \sum_{(x,y)}(I^{m(p)}_i(x,y)-\langle I^{m(p)}_i(x,y) \rangle)^2/\langle I^{m(p)}_i(x,y) \rangle^2}\\
    \langle\delta I^{\text{pm(mp)}}
    (x,y)\rangle & \equiv \sqrt{\sum_{i=0}^{19}(I^{p(m)}_i(x,y)-\langle I^{m(p)}_i(x,y) \rangle)^2 /\langle I^{m(p)}_i(x,y) \rangle^2}\\
